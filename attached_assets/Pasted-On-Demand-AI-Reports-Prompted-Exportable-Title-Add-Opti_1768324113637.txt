On-Demand AI Reports (Prompted, Exportable)
Title

Add Optional AI-Generated Reports from Chatbot (Prompt → Generate → Export)

Goal

Enable the chatbot to optionally generate structured, exportable reports based on a user’s question or statement.

The report should not generate immediately.
Instead, after a qualifying response, the chatbot should prompt:

“Would you like a report?”

If the user confirms, the system generates a side-panel / modal report using underlying platform data (e.g. P&L, labor, sales, inventory), with supporting tables, metrics, and commentary, and allow export.

This should feel similar to ChatGPT’s “Create a report?” UX.

Why This Matters

Prevents overwhelming users with long outputs

Keeps chat conversational while enabling deep, formal analysis on demand

Creates a reusable reporting engine across:

Profitability

Labor efficiency

Cost control

Trends & comparisons

Bonus eligibility (future)

User Flow (UX)
1. User asks a question or makes a statement

Examples:

“How profitable was October?”

“Why did margins drop last month?”

“Compare September vs October performance”

“Are we overspending on labor?”

2. Chatbot responds normally (concise)

High-level answer

Key takeaway(s)

No long tables or exports yet

3. Chatbot prompts for report (conditional)

If intent qualifies:

“Would you like a detailed report with supporting data?”
Buttons:

✅ Generate report

❌ No thanks

4. If user confirms → Generate Report

Report:

Opens in side panel / modal

Scrollable

Structured

Exportable

Report Structure (Standardized)

Each report should follow this schema (vary content by topic):

A. Report Header

Title (auto-generated)

Date range

Entity / Location(s)

Data sources used (e.g. P&L, payroll, POS)

B. Executive Summary

3–5 bullet insights

Plain-English, owner-friendly

Example:

“Net margin declined 2.3% MoM primarily due to labor inefficiency”

“Food cost remained stable at 28.4%”

C. Supporting Metrics & Tables

Driven by the question type.

Example: Profitability Report

Revenue

Gross profit

Net profit

Margin %

MoM / YoY deltas

Table sourced from P&L data

Example: Labor Report

Labor $

Labor %

Sales per labor hour

Overtime impact

D. Analysis & Commentary (AI)

Explain why changes occurred

Reference specific accounts or categories

Avoid speculation — cite data points used

E. Recommendations (Optional, Flagged)

Operational suggestions

Cost control ideas

Clearly labeled as recommendations (not facts)

Export Options

Report must be exportable as:

PDF

CSV (tables only)

Copy to clipboard (formatted Markdown)

Exports should reflect exactly what’s shown in the report.

AI / Data Behavior
Intent Detection

Report prompt should trigger when:

User asks about performance, trends, comparisons, causes, or summaries

Keywords include:

profitability

margin

P&L

labor

costs

trends

compare

why / explain

Data Rules

Use existing normalized data

P&L (accrual where available)

Payroll summaries

POS sales

No assumptions without data

If data is missing:

Call it out explicitly in report

Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

No automatic report generation without confirmation

No scheduling (future enhancement)

No cross-entity consolidation (v1 = single entity)

Acceptance Criteria

 Chatbot conditionally asks “Would you like a report?”

 Report does NOT generate unless user confirms

 Report opens in a dedicated UI (modal or side panel)

 Report includes structured sections (Summary, Data, Analysis)

 Report pulls real P&L / operational data

 Report is exportable (PDF + CSV)

 Report content varies correctly by user question

Future Extensions (Not Required)

Saved reports

Scheduled monthly reports

Shareable links

Bonus / KPI-based reports

Multi-location rollups
