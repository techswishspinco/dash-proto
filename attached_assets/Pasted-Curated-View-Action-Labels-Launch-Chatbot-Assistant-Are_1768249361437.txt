Curated View – Action Labels Launch Chatbot Assistant

Area: Accounting / P&L
View: Curated View (Owner, GM, Executive Chef)
Type: Interaction / AI Assistant Integration

Problem

In Curated Views, sections labeled “Action Labels” surface recommended actions, but they are currently passive text.

Users expect:

To click an action

To be guided on how to do it

To understand why it matters

Without an execution path, insights stall.

Goal

Make all “Action Labels” in Curated Views clickable so they open the chatbot assistant, preloaded with the specific action context, enabling guided execution.

Scope

This applies to all roles:

Owner

General Manager

Executive Chef

And to all Curated Views under:

Accounting → P&L

Core Rule (Non-Negotiable)

Every Action Label is a chatbot entry point.

If it’s labeled as an action, it must:

Be clickable

Open the chatbot assistant

Pass the action context into the assistant

Interaction Behavior
UI

Action Labels appear visually clickable (hover, cursor, subtle affordance)

Clicking an Action Label:

Opens chatbot assistant (side panel or modal)

Focuses input on the assistant

Context Passed to Assistant (Required)

Each click must inject structured context:

{
  role: "Owner" | "GM" | "ExecutiveChef",
  view: "Accounting/PnL/Curated",
  action_label: "<label text>",
  triggering_metrics: {
    metric_name,
    value,
    comparison_value,
    delta
  },
  timeframe,
  shift (optional)
}

Notes

This is the bridge from insight → execution.

Curated Views should feel like:

“Click → understand → act”

Not:

“See problem → figure it out yourself.”
