Owner Curated View – Integrate Profitability Insights Into Existing Cards (No New Sections)

Area: Accounting / P&L
View: Curated View → Owner
Type: Feature Enhancement / Insight Integration

Constraint (Locked)

✅ Do NOT add duplicate cards

✅ Do NOT add a new “Profitability” section or title

✅ Reuse and enhance existing cards only

✅ Visual layout remains recognizable

✅ Can add:

Sub-rows

Expand / dropdown behavior

Inline tables

Action labels

Chatbot triggers

Problem

The current Owner Curated View surfaces strong top-line signals, but profitability context is fragmented:

Gross profit, margins, NOI, and expense ratios are implicit, not explicit

Month-to-month drivers are not visible

Owners must mentally connect cards to understand why profitability changed

We want CFO-level profitability clarity without clutter or repetition.

Goal

Embed profitability intelligence directly into the existing Owner cards, so the owner can answer:

“Are we more profitable this month — and why?”

Without adding new cards or sections.

Existing Cards (Baseline)

These cards already exist and must remain:

Income

Marketing

Operating Expenses

Growth

Cash Flow (Owner Only)

Compensation Overview (Owner Only)

Enhancements by Card
1️⃣ Income Card → Add Gross Profit Context

Current

Revenue

% change vs prior

Enhancement (Expandable)
On click or dropdown, reveal:

Metric	Current	Prior	Δ
Gross Profit	$	$	↑ / ↓
Gross Margin	%	%	pts

Rules

Gross Profit = Revenue – COGS

Gross Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue

Values read from Sep / Oct JSON

No new card created

Action Label

2️⃣ Operating Expenses Card → Expense Quality Breakdown

Current

OpEx $

% of revenue

Enhancement (Inline Rows)
Add 2–3 inline rows under % of revenue:

Operating Expense Ratio

Expense as % of Revenue

Month-over-Month change (↑ / ↓)

Rules

Expense % = OpEx / Revenue

Expense as % = (COGS + OpEx) / Revenue

Action Labels

“What’s driving higher expenses?”

“Which categories increased most?”

3️⃣ Growth Card → Profit-Aware Growth

Current

Revenue growth status (Growing / Flat / Declining)

Enhancement
Append one line of context:

“Growth is profitable / margin-dilutive / expense-driven”

Logic

If revenue ↑ and operating margin ↑ → Profitable growth

If revenue ↑ and margin ↓ → Margin-dilutive growth

If revenue ↑ but NOI ↓ → Expense-driven growth

Action Label

“Is growth helping profitability?”

4️⃣ Cash Flow Card → Profitability Connection (Owner Only)

5️⃣ Compensation Overview → Margin Impact

Current

Manager spend

Enhancement
Add a subtle footer line:

“Management comp = X% of revenue”
