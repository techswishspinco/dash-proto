Title
Add Calendar Filter with P&L Status & Owner Controls on P&L Release Page

Context
On the /accounting/pnl route, specifically on the P&L Release page, users currently lack a structured calendar-style filter to manage reporting periods alongside P&L status and owner attribution.

We want to introduce a calendar filter UI similar to the attached reference, allowing users to quickly filter and understand P&L reports by date range, status, and owner in a single, intuitive control.

Objective
Build a calendar-based filter component that enables users to filter P&L data by:

Reporting period (via calendar/date picker)

P&L status (e.g. Draft, Reviewed, Finalized, Released)

Owner (e.g. Accountant, Manager, Owner, System)

This filter should be visually compact, easy to scan, and consistent with the rest of the Accounting UI.

Scope / Requirements

1. Calendar Filter

Date range selector (month-based by default, with custom range support)

Presets:

This Month

Last Month

Quarter to Date

Year to Date

Custom Range

Selected range should persist across navigation and refresh (URL params or state)

2. P&L Status Filter

Multi-select dropdown or pill-based filter

Status options (exact labels TBD, but include):

Draft

In Review

Finalized

Released

Ability to select multiple statuses at once

Visual indicator when filters are active

3. Owner Filter

Filter P&L entries by owner/responsible party

Example owners:

Accountant

Manager

Owner

System / Auto-generated

Should support multi-select

4. UI / UX

Filter should live near the top of the P&L Release page (above the table/list)

Calendar + status + owner should feel like one cohesive control (not scattered filters)

Active filters should be clearly visible and removable

Matches existing design system (spacing, typography, dropdown behavior)

5. Data Behavior

Filters should update the P&L list/table in real time

Backend/API queries should respect:

date_start / date_end

status[]

owner[]

Empty states should clearly indicate when no results match the filters

Acceptance Criteria

User can filter P&Ls by date range using a calendar UI

User can filter by one or more P&L statuses

User can filter by one or more owners

Filters persist when navigating within Accounting

Clear visual indication when filters are applied

No regression to existing P&L functionality

Notes

Reference image shows the intended UX direction (calendar-centric filter with status context)

This is part of the broader P&L Release experience and should be reusable for future Accounting views
