Accounting / P&L – Month-to-Month Comparisons Using Sep 2025 → Oct 2025

Area: Accounting / P&L
Views: Curated View (Owner / GM / Executive Chef), Detailed View, P&L Dashboard
Type: Data Comparison / Time-Series Logic

Problem

Month-to-month comparisons across Accounting / P&L views are currently inconsistent or implicit, which can cause:

Unclear “prior period” logic

Mismatched deltas across pages

Confusion during design, QA, and demos

We now have validated P&L data for September 2025 and October 2025, which should be used consistently as the reference months for all month-over-month comparisons.

Goal

Standardize all month-to-month comparisons in Accounting / P&L so that:

October 2025 is the current month

September 2025 is the prior comparison month

All deltas, trends, action items, and narratives reference this same pairing

Source Data (Authoritative)

September 2025 P&L JSON

October 2025 P&L JSON

These two files are the only sources used for month-to-month comparisons in this phase.

Required Comparison Logic
Definition (Non-Negotiable)
Month-to-Month Change =
October 2025 value – September 2025 value


For percentage metrics:

Δ % = (Oct – Sep)


For growth rates:

Growth % = (Oct – Sep) / Sep

Scope (Applies To)
Curated Views

Owner financial summaries

GM performance summaries

Executive Chef operational summaries

Detailed Views

Revenue

COGS Deep Dive

Labor Deep Dive

Prime Cost Analysis

Prime Cost Bridge

Dashboard Elements

KPI cards

Trend indicators (↑ ↓ →)

“What happened” narratives

Action labels

Pop-up / drill-in graphs

Data Consistency Rules (Critical)

All “previous month” references must point to September 2025

All “current month” references must point to October 2025

No dynamic or rolling month logic in this phase

No mixing of other months in calculations

Action Item Alignment

Action items triggered by month-to-month logic must:

Be based on Oct vs Sep deltas

Reference visible numbers from both months

Use correct language:

“Up vs last month (Sep 2025)”

“Down vs September”

No generic “last month” without context.

Narrative Copy Requirements

Examples:

“October labor increased compared to September.”

“Prime cost improved month-over-month in October.”

“COGS rose 2.1 pts vs September.”

Narratives must match the data exactly.

Pop-Up / Drill-Down Behavior

Any chart or modal showing month-to-month data must:

Show both September and October values

Use the same calculation logic as summary cards

Reconcile numerically with parent components

Out of Scope (This Ticket)

Rolling month logic

Auto-advancing months

Historical comparisons beyond Sep ↔ Oct

Forecasting

Acceptance Criteria

 All month-to-month comparisons use Sep 2025 → Oct 2025

 Deltas and growth rates calculate correctly

 KPI arrows and indicators align with comparisons

 Action items reference Sep vs Oct explicitly

 Narratives match the underlying numbers

 Pop-ups reconcile with parent views

Notes

This ticket intentionally locks time to create:

Deterministic behavior

Easier QA

Reliable demos

Clean design iteration

This should feel like:

“Every month-over-month insight is telling the same story.”
