Accounting / P&L – Labor Deep Dive Budget Defaults

Area: Accounting / P&L
View: Detailed View → Labor Deep Dive
Type: Feature / Budgeting Logic

Problem

In the Labor Deep Dive, users can see actual labor spend but lack a clear benchmark to evaluate performance.

Restaurant operators and CFOs typically manage labor against a target % of revenue, but without a default, users must guess whether labor is healthy or not.

Goal

Set a default Labor budget of 30% of revenue in the Labor Deep Dive, while allowing the budget to be customizable per restaurant.

This provides:

Immediate context for labor performance

Industry-standard defaults

Flexibility for different restaurant concepts

Default Budget Logic (Required)
Default Rule
Labor Budget = 30% of Revenue


Applies automatically if no custom labor budget is set

Clearly labeled as “Default”

Budget Calculations

For a given period:

Labor Budget ($) = Revenue × 0.30
Labor Variance ($) = Actual Labor – Budget Labor
Labor Variance (%) = (Actual Labor / Revenue) – 30%
