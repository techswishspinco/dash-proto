Curated View – Cursor-Driven Time Scrub & Minute-Level Zoom

Area: Accounting / P&L
Views: Curated View (GM & Executive Chef)
Sections: Hourly / Shift Breakdown, Ticket Performance
Type: Feature / Interaction & Visualization

Problem

Hourly views hide short-term operational spikes, but adding separate sliders increases UI clutter and cognitive load.

GMs and Executive Chefs expect direct manipulation:

Move the mouse

Inspect the moment

Zoom into detail

Not extra controls.

Goal

Enable cursor-driven time exploration where:

The mouse moves a vertical scrub line across the graph

Hovering reveals data

Dragging horizontally zooms into finer time resolution

Users can drill from hour → minute-level directly on the chart

No separate slider or control elements.

Core Interaction Model (Required)
Cursor Scrub Line

A vertical line follows the mouse across the chart

The line snaps to the nearest time bucket

Tooltip updates in real time

Click-and-Drag Zoom (On Chart)

Click + drag horizontally across the chart:

Narrows the visible time window

Automatically increases resolution

Example flow:

Full day (hourly)
→ drag 12pm–2pm
→ 15-min buckets
→ drag further
→ 5-min
→ 1-min


No explicit “mode switch”.

Resolution Rules
Zoom Level	Time Bucket
Default	60 minutes
Zoom 1	15 minutes
Zoom 2	5 minutes
Max Zoom	1 minute

Resolution increases automatically as the window shrinks

Resolution never exceeds data availability

Time-Range Alignment (Critical)

Cursor scrubbing and zooming do not change the selected time range

Day / Week / Month / Year remains fixed

This interaction only affects granularity + window

Visual Behavior

Vertical cursor line always visible on hover

Selected zoom window subtly highlighted

Axis labels update dynamically (e.g. 12:35, 12:40, etc.)

Hover / Tooltip Behavior

At minute resolution:

12:37 PM
Sales: $420
Labor: $165
Labor %: 39.3%


For Exec Chef:

12:37 PM
Tickets:
  Green: 3
  Yellow: 1
  Red: 2

Reset Behavior

Double-click anywhere on chart:

Resets to full-range hourly view

Zoom state resets when:

Location changes

Time range (Day / Week / Month / Year) changes

Data & Performance Constraints

Minute-level data loads only for visible window

Hard cap:

Max 120 minutes at 1-minute resolution

If data unavailable:

Fallback to nearest supported resolution

No blank states
