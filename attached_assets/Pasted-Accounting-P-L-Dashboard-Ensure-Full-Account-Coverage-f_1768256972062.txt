Accounting / P&L Dashboard – Ensure Full Account Coverage from Excel P&L

Area: Accounting / P&L
Page: P&L Dashboard
Type: Data Mapping / Completeness & Accuracy

Problem

The current P&L Dashboard in Accounting / P&L follows the correct visual and interaction specs, but it is not guaranteed that every account present in the P&L Excel is being represented in the dashboard structure.

This creates risk of:

Missing accounts in totals

Incorrect rollups

Incomplete analysis compared to the source-of-truth P&L

Goal

Keep the existing P&L dashboard specs exactly as-is, but ensure that:

All accounts from the attached P&L Excel are accounted for

Each account appears in the correct section

Sub-accounts are grouped logically under their parent accounts

Totals and rollups fully reconcile to the Excel

No visual redesign, no metric changes — this is a coverage and correctness pass.

Source of Truth

Attached File:
2025 09 SPOT SM_PL%.xlsx

This Excel defines:

All P&L accounts

Their hierarchy (parent → sub-accounts)

The authoritative list of what must appear in the dashboard

Required Behavior
1️⃣ Account Coverage (Mandatory)

Every account present in the Excel must be represented in the P&L dashboard

No account may be omitted from:

Totals

Section rollups

Detailed views

2️⃣ Account Hierarchy & Grouping

Accounts must be grouped using parent → sub-account hierarchy

Use indentation to represent structure

Example (illustrative only):

Cost of Goods Sold
  Food Cost
    Meat
    Produce
    Dry Goods
  Beverage Cost
    Alcohol
    Non-Alcoholic

3️⃣ Naming Rules

Use plain account names only

Do NOT display account code numbers

Names must match Excel naming (case-insensitive, punctuation tolerant)

4️⃣ Dashboard Structure (Unchanged)

Do NOT change:

Page layout

Sections

KPIs

Charts

Interactions

This ticket only affects:

Data mapping

Account inclusion

Hierarchy accuracy

Validation Rules
Rollup Accuracy

Parent totals must equal the sum of sub-accounts

Section totals must reconcile to Excel totals

Completeness Check

A 1:1 checklist must confirm:

Each Excel account exists in dashboard data

Each account rolls up into exactly one parent

Out of Scope (Explicit)

Renaming accounts

Creating new accounts

Changing dashboard visuals

Adding or removing sections

Editing Excel values

Acceptance Criteria

 All accounts from the Excel appear in the P&L dashboard data model

 Sub-accounts are grouped correctly using indentation

 No account codes are shown in the UI

 Parent totals reconcile to sub-accounts

 Dashboard totals reconcile to Excel totals

 Existing P&L dashboard specs remain unchanged

Notes

This ticket is about trust and accounting correctness, not UX iteration.

The end result should feel like:

“The dashboard is a faithful representation of the Excel P&L — nothing missing, nothing invented.”
