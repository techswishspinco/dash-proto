🎯 Work Pipeline / Task Queue Spec (Vesta-Inspired)
For Restaurant Payroll & Compliance Platform
🧩 1. Overview

The Work Pipeline is a centralized task system that continuously analyzes payroll, compliance, and operational data to surface the next best action for users.

It automatically creates, routes, prioritizes, and escalates tasks across roles so that users always know what to work on next — just like Vesta’s task-based workflow, where users “just do the next task rather than figuring out what to do next.”

Key Goals:
✔ Detect incomplete onboarding
✔ Identify mapping gaps
✔ Alert before payroll runs and tax deadlines
✔ Surface anomalies and data issues
✔ Prioritize tasks by urgency
✔ Route tasks to appropriate roles
✔ Support task resolution, reassignment, and tracking

🧠 2. User Roles & Permissions

Tasks are visible and actionable based on role. Roles each have tailored visibility and capabilities.

Role	Sees Tasks	Can Assign	Can Resolve	Typical Priorities
Operator	Ops & Payroll	Yes	Yes	Medium
Manager	Ops & People	Yes	Yes	Medium
Accountant / Bookkeeper	Finance & Compliance	Yes	Yes	High
Internal Support	All	Yes	Yes	Highest
Onboarding Specialist	Onboarding & Mapping	Yes	Yes	High
🚦 3. Task Priorities

Tasks are ordered by urgency and impact — particularly ensuring employees get paid on time and compliance isn’t compromised.

Priority	Conditions
Critical	Payroll errors, overdue taxes, failed/partial runs, unmapped employees
High	Mapping gaps, upcoming deadlines (within 1 week)
Medium	Sync and export gaps, non-critical data issues
Low	Cleanup suggestions or optional improvements
🧱 4. Task Types & Triggers

Tasks are grouped by business condition and lifecycle stage:

A) Onboarding Tasks

Triggered when:

Legal entity or company profile unfinished

POS not mapped

Pay schedule not defined

Employees missing onboarding data

Example:

Title: Complete Employee Onboarding — 12 employees

Description: 12 employees in POS not mapped to payroll.

Assigned to: Onboarding Specialist / Manager

Priority: High

B) Mapping Tasks

Triggered when:

POS employee is not mapped

Payroll employee record missing

Location not correctly linked to legal entity

Special Notes:

Support grouping — e.g., one task for multiple unmapped employees at a location.

C) Payroll Run Tasks

Triggered:

1 week before scheduled payroll

On missed payroll run

On failed or partial run

Example:

Title: Payroll in 7 days

Description: Verify timesheets & exports for 2026-01-15 run.

Assigned to: Manager + Accountant

Priority: High

D) Tax & Compliance Tasks

Triggered:

30 days before tax deadlines (federal/state)

Missing tax registrations

Overdue tax payments

These tasks ensure compliance windows don’t slip through the cracks.

E) Anomaly / Data Sync Tasks

Triggered when:

POS ↔ payroll sync fails

Payroll export to accounting fails

Hour mismatches detected

Duplicate or invalid employee data (e.g., missing SSN)

🕒 5. Escalation & Recurrence Rules
Escalation Logic

Unresolved tasks automatically rise in urgency based on time and business impact:

Critical → escalates if unresolved after 24 hours

High → escalates after 48–72 hours

Medium → flagged after 7 days

Low → flagged after 14 days

Users can override priorities manually based on business context.

Recurrence Behavior

If underlying conditions persist:

Critical tasks (like failed payroll) reappear each cycle until fixed.

Other tasks remain open until resolved or manually reactivated.

Example: If a run fails again next week, a fresh Critical task is generated.

🔔 6. Notifications

In-App Only

Tasks and alerts appear in the Work Pipeline dashboard and relevant module screens:

Work Queue (global task center)

Payroll view (upcoming run alerts)

Mapping screens

Onboarding screens

Tax Center

Badges and indicators show counts by priority and role.

🧰 7. Auto-Assignment Rules

Tasks are initially routed based on role relevance:

Task Type	Default Assignment
Onboarding	Onboarding Specialist / Manager
Mapping Errors	Manager / Accountant
Payroll Alerts	Manager + Accountant
Tax Alerts	Accountant
Critical Failures	Internal Support

Users can reassign tasks to any team member at any time.

🧾 8. Task Information Fields (Conceptual)

Each task includes these core dimensions:

Task Title

Description / Business context

Type (Onboarding, Mapping, Payroll, Tax, Anomaly)

Priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

Status (Open, In Progress, Snoozed, Resolved)

Who it’s assigned to

When it was created

Due date

Related business items (company, location, employees, payroll run)

In-app notifications

Escalation history

🧠 9. Decision Rules for Task Creation

Rather than code, think of these as business conditions that trigger tasks:

When payroll schedule exists and next run is 7 days away → create a Payroll Reminder task.

When an employee appears in POS without a payroll mapping → create a Mapping Gap task.

When sync errors occur between systems → create an Anomaly task.

When 30 days remain on a tax deadline → create a Tax Reminder task.

This mirrors Vesta’s rules-based workflow that automatically creates and prioritizes tasks based on business logic.
