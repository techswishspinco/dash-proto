Accounting / P&L – Month-to-Month Comparisons from JSON (Sep 2025 → Oct 2025)

Area: Accounting / P&L
Views: Curated View (Owner / GM / Executive Chef), Detailed View, P&L Dashboard
Type: Data Integration / Comparison Logic

Problem

Month-to-month comparisons across Accounting / P&L must be:

Consistent

Deterministic

Traceable to source data

We now have September 2025 and October 2025 P&L data available as JSON, but comparisons are not yet guaranteed to:

Read directly from these files

Use the same logic everywhere

Reconcile across cards, charts, narratives, and pop-ups

Goal

Standardize all month-to-month comparisons by:

Reading directly from the September 2025 and October 2025 P&L JSON files

Treating:

October 2025 as current month

September 2025 as prior month

Ensuring every comparison, action item, and narrative references this same data

Source of Truth (Required)

All month-to-month logic must read from:

2025_09_SPOT_SM_PL.json

2025_10_SPOT_SM_PL.json

No hardcoded values.
No derived “mock” months.
No dynamic rolling logic in this phase.

Required Comparison Logic
Definition (Non-Negotiable)
Month-to-Month Change =
October 2025 value – September 2025 value

Percentage Metrics
Δ pts = Oct % – Sep %

Growth Metrics
Growth % = (Oct – Sep) / Sep

Scope (Applies To)
Curated Views

Owner financial summaries

GM performance summaries

Executive Chef summaries (where applicable)

Detailed Views

Revenue

COGS Deep Dive

Labor Deep Dive

Prime Cost Analysis

Prime Cost Bridge

P&L Dashboard

KPI cards

Trend arrows (↑ ↓ →)

Month-to-month deltas

Charts and summaries

Data Consumption Rules (Critical)

All “current month” values must come from October 2025 JSON

All “previous month” values must come from September 2025 JSON

Each metric must:

Read from the same account(s) in both files

Use identical aggregation logic

If a value appears on screen, it must be traceable to one of the two JSON files.

Action Items (Required)

Action items driven by month-to-month changes must:

Be calculated from Oct vs Sep JSON values

Reference visible numbers from both months

Use explicit language:

“Up vs September 2025”

“Down month-over-month (Sep → Oct)”

No generic “last month” phrasing.

Narrative (“What happened”) Alignment

Narratives must:

Reflect Oct vs Sep comparisons

Match the computed deltas exactly

Avoid implying trends outside these two months

Examples:

“Labor increased in October compared to September.”

“Prime cost improved month-over-month.”

Pop-Up / Drill-In Graph Rules

All pop-ups and expanded charts must:

Read from the same JSON files

Display September and October values consistently

Reconcile numerically with parent cards and summaries

Validation Requirements
Data Integrity Checks

Account totals match between views

Parent rollups equal sum of sub-accounts

Prime Cost = COGS + Labor (for both months)

QA Expectations

Switching views does not change Oct/Sep numbers

All MoM deltas match manual calculation from JSON

No discrepancies between dashboard, curated, and detailed views

Out of Scope (This Ticket)

Rolling month logic

Auto-advancing periods

Comparisons beyond Sep ↔ Oct

Forecasting or budgeting changes

Acceptance Criteria

 All MoM comparisons read from Sep & Oct 2025 JSON files

 October is always treated as current month

 September is always treated as prior month

 Deltas and growth rates calculate correctly

 Action items are justified by JSON data

 Narratives and pop-ups reconcile with source data

 No hardcoded month values remain

Notes

This ticket intentionally locks time and data to ensure:

Reliable demos

Deterministic QA

High trust in numbers

It should feel like:

“Every month-to-month insight is reading from the same two files.”
