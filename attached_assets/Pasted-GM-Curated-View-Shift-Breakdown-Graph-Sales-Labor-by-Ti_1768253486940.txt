GM Curated View – Shift Breakdown Graph (Sales & Labor by Time of Day)

Area: Accounting / P&L
View: Curated View → General Manager
Section: Performance Summary → Shift Breakdown
Type: Feature / Visualization

Problem

GMs need to understand how sales and labor behave at different times of the day, not just at a daily total level.

Today, shift insights are:

Mostly textual

Hard to correlate sales vs labor visually

Not clearly aligned with the selected time range (day / week / month / year)

This makes it difficult to answer:

“Did labor match demand during lunch vs dinner?”

Goal

Add a Shift Breakdown graph that visually shows:

Sales

Labor cost

Across different times of day, and that fully respects the selected time range from the Performance Summary.

Core Behavior
Time-Range Alignment (Critical)

The Shift Breakdown graph must always match the currently selected time range from the Performance Summary:

Day

Week

Month

Year

One selector controls all related views.

Graph Requirements
Graph Type

Combined bar + line chart (or dual-axis bar chart)

X-Axis (Time of Day Buckets)

Default buckets:

Breakfast (optional / configurable)

Lunch

Dinner

Late Night (if applicable)

OR (implementation-friendly fallback):

Hour blocks (e.g. 10–12, 12–2, 2–4, etc.)

Bucket logic must be consistent across time ranges.

Y-Axis

Sales ($)

Labor Cost ($)

If dual-axis:

Left axis: Sales

Right axis: Labor cost

Time Range Aggregation Rules
Day

Show sales and labor for each time-of-day bucket for that day

Week

Aggregate sales and labor by time-of-day bucket across the week

Example:

Avg or total Lunch sales this week

Avg or total Lunch labor this week

Month / Year

Aggregate consistently using the same logic as Week

Use either:

Average per day

Total for the period
(Choose one and keep consistent; default recommendation: average per day)

Hover / Tooltip Behavior

On hover over a bucket:

Time-of-day label

Sales ($)

Labor cost ($)

Optional:

Labor % of sales

Example:

Lunch
Sales: $18,400
Labor: $6,200
Labor %: 33.7%

Data Consistency Rules

Sales and labor must reconcile to:

Performance Summary totals for the same period

Shift breakdown totals must equal the sum of all buckets

No independent calculations outside the selected time range

Acceptance Criteria

 Shift Breakdown renders as a graph

 Shows sales and labor cost by time of day

 Fully synced with Performance Summary time range

 Hover shows clear dollar values

 Totals reconcile with summary metrics

 Works for Day / Week / Month / Year
