Accounting / P&L – Prime Cost Target Linked to NY Benchmark & Prime Cost Bridge

Area: Accounting / P&L
View: Detailed View → Prime Cost Analysis
Type: Feature / Benchmarking & Analysis

Problem

Prime Cost targets are most useful when they:

Reflect real-world regional benchmarks (e.g., New York)

Stay customizable for individual restaurants

Flow consistently into deeper analysis tools like the Prime Cost Bridge

Without this linkage:

Targets feel arbitrary

Bridge analysis lacks context

Users can’t trust variance explanations

Goal

Connect the Prime Cost Target to:

New York industry benchmark defaults

Customizable Prime Cost budgets

Prime Cost Bridge analysis

So that all Prime Cost numbers reflect the same benchmark source and update together.

Core Concepts
Prime Cost Definition
Prime Cost = (COGS + Labor) / Revenue

Benchmark Source Logic (Required)
Default Benchmark

Industry Default: 55%–60%

New York Benchmark

58%–65% (Full-Service Restaurant default)

Selection Rules

If restaurant location = New York:

Default Prime Cost target = NY Benchmark

Otherwise:

Default to Industry Benchmark

Customizable Budget Override
Behavior

Users can edit:

Lower bound (%)

Upper bound (%)

Rules

Editing creates a Custom Prime Cost Target

Custom target overrides benchmark everywhere:

Prime Cost Analysis

Prime Cost Bridge

Status indicators

Labeling

“Prime Cost Target: 58%–65% (NY Benchmark)”

“Prime Cost Target: 60%–63% (Custom)”

Prime Cost Bridge Integration (Required)
Bridge Inputs

Prime Cost Bridge must reference:

Actual Prime Cost %

Target Prime Cost % (midpoint or range)

Revenue

COGS

Labor

Bridge Calculations

Variances shown in the bridge must reconcile to:

Actual Prime Cost – Target Prime Cost


Target value source:

Custom target (if exists)

NY Benchmark (if NY location)

Industry default (fallback)

Prime Cost Bridge Display

Bridge should explain:

How much of the variance vs target is driven by:

Labor

COGS

Example:

Prime Cost: 62.4%
Target (NY): 60.0%
Variance: +2.4 pts

Drivers:
• Labor: +1.6 pts
• COGS: +0.8 pts

Data Consistency Requirement (Critical)

All Prime Cost–related components must use the same target source:

Prime Cost KPI

Status indicators

Bridge analysis

Action Labels

No component may define its own benchmark.
