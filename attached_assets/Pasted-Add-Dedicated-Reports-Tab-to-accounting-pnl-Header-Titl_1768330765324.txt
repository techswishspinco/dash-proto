Add Dedicated “Reports” Tab to /accounting/pnl Header
Title

Create Dedicated “Reports” Tab in /accounting/pnl Header (Independent of Chatbot)

Goal

Introduce a persistent, first-class “Reports” tab in the /accounting/pnl header that serves as the single surface for viewing and generating reports, independent of chatbot state.

This replaces reliance on chatbot gating or report-mode toggles.

Header Navigation Change
Add New Tab

Update the /accounting/pnl header to include:

Curated | Detailed View | P&L Dashboard | Reports


The Reports tab should always be visible.

Reports Tab Behavior (v1)
Default State

When a user clicks Reports:

Show an empty state if no reports exist

Copy example:

“No reports yet. Generate a report to get started.”

(No auto-generation.)

Report List

If reports exist:

Display a list of previously generated reports

Each item shows:

Report title

Created timestamp

Report type (e.g. Profitability, Cost, Comparison)

Selecting a report loads it in the main content area.

Generate Report Action

Inside the Reports tab:

Provide a Generate Report CTA

Clicking it:

Opens existing report-generation flow (unchanged)

Uses current P&L context (month, view)

❗ Do not alter report logic — only entry point.

Report Rendering Rules

Reuse the existing report component

Render report content exactly as it exists today

No visual, textual, or structural changes

State & Persistence (v1)

Reports persist for the session

No deletion or renaming

No cross-session persistence

Explicit Non-Goals

❌ No chatbot changes

❌ No gating via chat prompts

❌ No report redesign

❌ No action cart integration

❌ No auto-generated reports

Technical Notes

Reports tab state should manage:

reports[]

activeReportId

Chatbot may still reference reports but is not required for navigation

Avoid coupling Reports tab lifecycle to chat state

Acceptance Criteria

 Reports tab appears in /accounting/pnl header

 Tab is always visible

 Empty state renders correctly

 Existing reports render unchanged

 Multiple reports can be selected

 No regression to Curated / Detailed / Dashboard views

QA Checklist

Navigate between tabs → no state leakage

Generate report → appears in Reports list

Reload page → session-scoped behavior holds

No chat interaction required to view reports

Why This Works

Removes brittle chat coupling

Makes reports discoverable

Matches mental model: P&L → Reports

Future-proofs scheduled, saved, and shared reports
