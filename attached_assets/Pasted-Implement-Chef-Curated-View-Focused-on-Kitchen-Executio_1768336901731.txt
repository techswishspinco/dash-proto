Implement Chef Curated View Focused on Kitchen Execution, Food Cost per Plate, and Exception-Based Insights

Background (User Feedback Incorporated)

Feedback indicates:

Curated and Detailed views feel too similar

Users don’t know what to look at first

Curated should point to a problem, not explain everything

Different roles need different focal points

Chefs think in food cost, waste, prep, and execution, not financial health

Visual hierarchy is missing

Stats need context

We should not lose any existing data

Data accountants don’t normally have (e.g., per-plate cost) is highly valuable

Chef Curated View Purpose (Locked)

Chef Curated View exists to answer:
“What kitchen issue needs my attention right now, and what is driving food cost or execution problems?”

This view is:

Operational

Exception-driven

Focused on one primary kitchen issue

A pointer into Detailed view for deeper analysis

Explicit Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

❌ No Financial Health card for Chef

❌ No report generation

❌ No chatbot UX changes

❌ No data removal

❌ No deep charts or long tables

❌ No financial framing (revenue, margin, cash flow)

Layout & Visual Hierarchy (Chef Only)
Default State (On Load)

Visible:

✅ Primary Kitchen Insight Card (dominant, top)

✅ Secondary Kitchen Metrics Group (supporting, below)

Hidden:

Income

Marketing

Growth

Cash Flow

Financial Health

Primary Kitchen Insight (Chef)
Definition

Primary Kitchen Insight = the single most critical kitchen-related “red” or exception item requiring attention

Eligible Signals (Ranked)

Primary insight must be selected from:

Food Cost per Plate above acceptable range

Food COGS % over target

High waste or ingredient variance

Prep inefficiency impacting yield

Menu item cost imbalance

Rank by:

Severity vs target

Dollar impact

Kitchen controllability

Exactly one insight is selected.

Example Primary Insights

“Food cost per plate elevated in dairy-based items”

“Milky Puff per-plate cost exceeded acceptable range”

“Protein waste driving food cost variance”

“Prep inefficiency increasing per-plate cost”

Primary Kitchen Insight Card (UI)
Card Content

Status Indicator

Red = needs attention

Green = on track

Headline (Large, Kitchen Language)

Clear, actionable, non-financial wording

Context Line

Explains why the issue matters in kitchen terms

Key Metrics (Max 3)

Avg food cost per plate

Target or acceptable range

Cost % of selling price (if relevant)

CTA

“View kitchen breakdown”

Entire card is clickable

Food Cost per Plate (Core Chef Metric)
Inclusion Rule

Food Cost per Plate must be visible in Chef Curated View.

It is a first-class kitchen metric, not secondary enrichment.

Placement

Appears directly below the Primary Insight Card

Visually secondary

Always visible (not hidden behind toggles)

Summary Content

Display:

Average FC per plate

Range (low → high)

Count of items above acceptable range

Optional compact highlights:

Top 3 highest FC per plate items (name + $ + %)

Secondary Kitchen Metrics (Preserved Data)

All existing Curated metrics must remain, but:

Grouped

Visually de-emphasized

Clearly subordinate to the Primary Insight

Examples:

Food COGS %

Waste indicators

Prep efficiency signals

Inventory usage summaries

Enrichment Rules (Chef)

Allowed only if it explains urgency:

Ingredient-level variance (e.g. dairy, protein)

Waste spikes

Prep yield issues

❌ No charts
❌ No long tables
❌ No exploratory analysis

Navigation: Auto-Link to Detailed View

Clicking:

Primary Insight Card

OR highlighted per-plate items

Will:

Switch to Detailed View

Auto-scroll to the relevant section:

Food cost variance

Menu item cost breakdown

Waste & prep efficiency

Data Preservation Rule

❗ No existing Curated data may be removed.

Allowed:

Reordering

Grouping

Visual hierarchy changes

Not allowed:

Deleting metrics

Moving data exclusively to Detailed

Acceptance Criteria

 Chef sees one clear kitchen issue on load

 No Financial Health card appears

 Food cost per plate is visible and contextualized

 Per-plate variance can drive the primary insight

 All existing Curated data remains accessible

 Clicking insight navigates correctly to Detailed

 Curated feels decisional, not exploratory

QA Checklist

Switch role → Chef

Load Curated → one dominant kitchen issue

High FC/plate item → becomes primary insight

Verify per-plate numbers match source

Click insight → Detailed scrolls correctly

Confirm no data loss

Why This Solves the Feedback

This implementation:

Creates strong visual hierarchy

Makes Curated clearly different from Detailed

Uses chef-native metrics (per plate, waste, prep)

Preserves all data

Guides action without overwhelming

Curated becomes a daily kitchen management surface, not a dashboard.
