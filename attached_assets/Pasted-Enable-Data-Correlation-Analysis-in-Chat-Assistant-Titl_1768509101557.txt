Enable Data Correlation Analysis in Chat Assistant
Title

Add Data Correlation Capability to Chat Assistant (Explain “Why” Across Metrics)

Context

Today, the product surfaces individual metric changes (e.g. sales up, marketing up, labor up), but users still have to mentally connect why those changes happened.

Example user question we want to support:

“Did the increase in marketing lead to higher sales?”

or

“Why did sales go up this month?”

We want the chat assistant to be able to:

Correlate multiple metrics

Explain directional relationships

Clearly state confidence vs uncertainty

This aligns with the core product philosophy:

Explain why something changed, not just that it changed.

Goal

Enable the chat assistant to perform basic data correlation analysis across available metrics and explain the relationship in plain language.

Example output:

“Sales increased 8.2% this month, which correlates with a 15% increase in marketing spend. Historically, similar marketing increases have coincided with higher weekday dinner sales.”

Scope

✅ Chat assistant only
✅ Read-only analytics
❌ No automatic actions
❌ No predictive guarantees

Supported Correlations (Initial)

The assistant should be able to correlate changes across:

Marketing spend ↔ Sales

Labor hours ↔ Sales volume

COGS ↔ Menu mix

Channel sales ↔ Total revenue

Daypart sales ↔ Labor allocation

(Only when both metrics exist in the data)

Correlation Rules

Use directional correlation, not causal claims

Phrase results as:

“correlates with”

“is associated with”

“tends to move with”

Never state certainty unless mathematically obvious

Data Inputs

The assistant may use:

Time-series metrics (MoM, WoW, period comparisons)

Budget vs actual deltas

Channel-level breakdowns

Category-level rollups

No external data sources.

Assistant Behavior
1. Trigger

When a user asks:

“Why did X increase/decrease?”

“Did X affect Y?”

“What caused this change?”

The assistant should attempt correlation automatically.

2. Correlation Logic (MVP)

Compare % change across the same time window

Identify aligned directional movement

Check historical consistency (if available)

If insufficient data:

Say so explicitly

Example:

“There isn’t enough historical data to confirm a relationship, but this month both metrics moved up.”

3. Explain in Plain Language

Responses must:

Name both metrics

State direction and magnitude

Explain how they may be connected

Highlight uncertainty when applicable

UI / Output Format

Narrative explanation (default)

Optional bullet summary:

Metric A change

Metric B change

Relationship confidence (Low / Medium / High)

No charts required in this ticket.

Out of Scope

❌ Advanced statistical modeling

❌ Forecasting

❌ Automated recommendations

❌ Action enforcement

Acceptance Criteria

✅ Assistant can compare two or more metrics
✅ Uses correlation language (not causation)
✅ Explains relationships in plain English
✅ Clearly states uncertainty when data is weak
✅ Fails gracefully when correlation isn’t possible

Notes for AI Agent

This is an explanatory intelligence feature

Accuracy > confidence

Never invent relationships

Prefer fewer, clearer correlations over many weak ones
