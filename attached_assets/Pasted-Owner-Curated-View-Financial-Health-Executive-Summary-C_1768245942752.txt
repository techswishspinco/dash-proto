Owner Curated View – Financial Health & Executive Summary Cards

Area: Accounting / P&L
View: Curated View → Owner
Type: Feature / Dashboard

Problem

Restaurant owners need a clear, opinionated snapshot of their business that answers:

Are we financially healthy?

Are costs under control?

Are we growing or slipping?

Where is money being spent — without leaking sensitive payroll data?

Traditional P&Ls are detailed but do not provide judgment. Owners expect a CFO-style interpretation, not raw numbers.

Goal

Create an Owner-only Curated View in Accounting / P&L that surfaces high-level financial insight cards, including a CFO-aligned Financial Health score, while respecting strict permission boundaries around compensation and cash.

Cards Included (v1)

Cards render at the top of Accounting → P&L → Curated View → Owner, above detailed tables.

Financial Health Formula (Required)

Financial Health is a weighted composite score across three CFO pillars.

Pillar 1: Profitability (40%)

Metrics

Gross Margin = (Revenue – COGS) / Revenue
Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue


Scoring Logic

Gross Margin weighted 60%

Net Margin weighted 40%

Benchmarks

Gross Margin: 65%+ healthy, <60% risk

Net Margin: 10%+ healthy, <5% risk

Pillar 2: Efficiency (35%)

Metrics

Prime Cost Ratio = (COGS + Labor) / Revenue
Operating Expense Ratio = Operating Expenses / Revenue


Scoring Logic

Prime Cost weighted 70%

OpEx weighted 30%

Benchmarks

Prime Cost ≤ 60% healthy, >65% risk

OpEx ≤ 30% healthy, >35% risk

Pillar 3: Stability (25%)

Metrics

Revenue Growth = (Current Period – Prior Period) / Prior Period
Cash Coverage = Cash / Avg Monthly OpEx


Rules

If cash data is unavailable, stability is based solely on revenue trend

Cash coverage ≥ 3 months = healthy

Final Score
Financial Health =
(Profitability × 0.40)
+ (Efficiency × 0.35)
+ (Stability × 0.25)

Health Status Mapping

It is interpretive, opinionated, and owner-first.
