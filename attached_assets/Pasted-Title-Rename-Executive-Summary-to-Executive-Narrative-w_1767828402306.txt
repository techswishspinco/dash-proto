Title
Rename Executive Summary to Executive Narrative with Data-Driven Performance Summary (Detailed View)

Context
In /accounting/pnl → Detailed View, there is currently a section labeled “Executive Summary.” As the product evolves, this label no longer accurately reflects the intent of the section.

We want to reposition this section as an Executive Narrative — a data-driven, automatically generated performance explanation that helps users understand what happened and why, based on actual P&L data.

This section should feel analytical and narrative-driven, not static or manually written.

Objective

Replace Executive Summary with Executive Narrative, and introduce a Performance Summary that is dynamically generated from P&L data in the Detailed View.

Scope / Requirements
1. Rename Section

Change header text:

From: Executive Summary

To: Executive Narrative

Update all references in:

UI labels

Internal naming

Analytics / tracking (if applicable)

2. Executive Narrative Content

The section should present a plain-language narrative explaining P&L performance

Narrative must be:

Generated from real financial data

Period-aware (current period vs comparison period)

Concise, professional, and neutral in tone

Example themes (not hardcoded):

Revenue growth/decline and primary drivers

Margin movement and cost pressure

Labor and prime cost behavior

Notable variances vs prior period or budget (if available)

3. Performance Summary (Data-Backed)

Directly below or within the Executive Narrative, include a Performance Summary composed of structured insights, such as:

Revenue ▲/▼ vs prior period

Net income ▲/▼ and margin change

Labor % trend

Food cost % trend

Largest positive and negative variances

Rules:

Insights must be derived from actual P&L line items

Numbers should be contextualized (%, $ delta, direction)

Avoid generic statements like “performance improved”

4. Data Logic (High-Level)

Performance Summary should compute:

Period-over-period deltas

Percentage change

Materiality thresholds (e.g. only surface meaningful changes)

Narrative should update automatically when:

Date range changes

Filters change

New data is synced

5. UI / UX

Executive Narrative should live at the top of the Detailed View

Read-only (no manual editing in v1)

Clear separation between:

Narrative text

Structured performance bullets or callouts

Should feel authoritative and CFO-grade, not marketing copy

Acceptance Criteria

“Executive Summary” is fully replaced with “Executive Narrative”

Narrative text is dynamically generated from P&L data

Performance Summary reflects real period-over-period metrics

Content updates when filters/date ranges change

No regressions to existing Detailed View sections

Notes

This is not the Curated View summary — this remains part of Detailed View

This section sets the groundwork for future:

AI-assisted explanations

Exported executive reports

Stakeholder-facing narratives
