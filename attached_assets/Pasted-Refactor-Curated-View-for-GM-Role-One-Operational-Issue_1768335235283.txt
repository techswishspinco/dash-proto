Refactor Curated View for GM Role: One Operational Issue, Clear Context, No Financial Health Card

Problem (GM-Specific)

General Managers do not think in terms of “Financial Health.”
They operate on:

Labor execution

Throughput

Staffing efficiency

Service performance

The current Curated view:

Feels financial and abstract

Lacks a clear operational focal point

Shows too many metrics at once

Does not clearly answer: “What do I need to fix today?”

Goal

Redesign Curated View for the GM role so it:

Surfaces one urgent operational issue

Uses red / exception signals

Preserves all existing data

Prioritizes execution over finance

Clearly points to the next step (Detailed view)

GM Curated View Definition (Locked)

GM Curated View answers:
“What operational issue needs my attention right now, and where do I go to understand it?”

Layout & Hierarchy (GM Only)
Default State (On Load)

Visible:

✅ Primary Operational Insight Card (single, dominant)

Below (secondary, grouped):

Labor

Sales

Ticket Time

Throughput-related metrics

Hidden by default:

❌ Financial Health

❌ Income / Marketing / Growth / Cash Flow groupings

Financial categories may exist as secondary context only, never as the entry point.

Primary Operational Insight (GM)
Selection Rules

Choose exactly one primary insight based on:

Labor % over target

Ticket time degradation

Sales underperformance caused by execution

Prime cost issues driven by labor

Overtime / staffing mismatch

Rank by:

Severity (red / exception)

Impact on service or sales

Operational controllability

GM Primary Insight Examples

“Labor inefficiency during peak hours”

“Ticket times increased 18% during dinner service”

“Sales missed target due to throughput constraints”

“Overtime driving labor cost variance”

Primary Operational Insight Card (GM)
Card Content

1. Status Indicator

Red = immediate attention

Green = on track

2. Headline (Large, Action-Oriented)

Operational language only

Examples:

“Labor inefficiency during peak hours”

“Service throughput slowed in weeks 1–2”

3. Context Line

Tie execution → outcome

Examples:

“Labor ran 4.2% over target, impacting margins”

“Ticket times exceeded SLA during peak hours”

4. Key Metrics (Max 3)

Labor % vs target

Ticket time delta

Sales impact (if relevant)

5. CTA

“View breakdown”

Entire card is clickable

Secondary Metrics (GM)

All existing Curated metrics must remain, but:

Visually subordinate

Grouped logically

Never compete with the primary insight

Examples:

Labor summary card

Sales vs target

Peak vs off-peak indicators

Enrichment Rules (GM)

Allowed only when it explains urgency:

Ticket time spikes

Peak-hour staffing mismatches

Week/day-level execution issues

Example:

“Ticket times were red during Week 1–2 dinner service”

❌ No charts
❌ No deep tables

Auto-Link to Detailed View

Clicking the Primary Insight Card:

Switches to Detailed View

Auto-scrolls to the relevant section:

Labor efficiency

Ticket time performance

Labor ↔ sales correlation

Example mapping:

{
  role: "GM",
  insightType: "ticket_time",
  targetSectionId: "ticket-time-performance"
}

Data Preservation Rule (Non-Negotiable)

❗ No existing Curated data may be removed.

Allowed:

Reordering

Grouping

De-emphasis

Not allowed:

Deleting metrics

Moving data exclusively to Detailed

Explicit Non-Goals

❌ No Financial Health card

❌ No report generation

❌ No chatbot UX changes

❌ No Owner or Chef logic

❌ No new calculations

❌ No deep analysis in Curated

Acceptance Criteria

 GM sees one clear operational issue on load

 No Financial Health card appears for GM

 Primary insight is operational, not financial

 Secondary metrics are present but subordinate

 Clicking insight navigates to correct Detailed section

 No data loss from Curated

QA Checklist (GM)

Switch role → GM

Load Curated → single operational focus

Red ticket-time issue → becomes primary insight

Click insight → Detailed scrolls correctly

All prior Curated metrics still visible

Why This Is Correct for GMs

Owners care about health
GMs care about execution

This design:

Matches how GMs think

Reduces cognitive load

Makes Curated actually useful day-to-day
