Sync Curated View Data to Uploaded JSON & PDF Sources
Title

Fix Curated View Data Mismatch — Ensure 100% Fidelity to Uploaded JSONs & PDF

Context

We uploaded 2 JSON files and 1 PDF that define the authoritative data and terminology for the restaurant being analyzed.

However, parts of the UI—specifically Curated View → Owner View → Missed Targets—are still showing placeholder or incorrect items that do not exist in the source documents.

Example:

Items like “avocado” and “lime” appear in Missed Targets

The analyzed restaurant does not sell these items

These terms do not appear in either JSON nor the PDF

This indicates the UI is not fully bound to the uploaded source data.

Goal

Ensure all displayed data, labels, and words in Curated View are derived only from the uploaded JSONs and PDF, with zero placeholders, mock data, or hardcoded examples remaining.

Scope (Do Not Expand)

❌ Do NOT add new insights or logic

❌ Do NOT change layout or card structure

❌ Do NOT invent or infer missing data

✅ ONLY reconcile UI → source documents

Requirements
1. Source-of-Truth Enforcement

Treat the 2 uploaded JSONs + PDF as authoritative

UI must reflect:

Exact menu items

Exact wording

Exact categories

Exact metrics

If a value does not exist in those documents:

It must not appear in the UI

2. Curated View – Owner View Fix

Audit Missed Targets section

Remove any items not found in source docs

e.g. “avocado”, “lime”

Replace with:

Valid items from the uploaded data OR

Hide the row entirely if no valid data exists

3. Global Curated View Audit

Perform a sweep across:

Primary Insight cards

Missed Targets

Goal explanations

Supporting text under charts

Check for:

Hardcoded food items

Placeholder examples

Generic restaurant copy

All must map directly to:

JSON keys/values

PDF text/content

4. Binding Rules

All Curated View components must:

Read from parsed JSON data

Use derived values only

Never reference static demo strings

If fallback logic exists:

It must be data-driven

No food/item examples allowed unless present in source

Acceptance Criteria

✅ No menu items appear unless present in JSON or PDF
✅ No placeholder food terms anywhere in Curated View
✅ Missed Targets shows only valid restaurant-specific data
✅ Every word shown can be traced back to source docs
✅ If data is missing → UI hides or collapses gracefully

Verification Steps

Open Curated View → Owner View

Inspect Missed Targets

Cross-check every item against:

JSON #1

JSON #2

Uploaded PDF

Confirm zero mismatches

Notes for AI Agent

This is a data integrity fix, not a UI redesign

Treat unknown values as invalid, not improvable
