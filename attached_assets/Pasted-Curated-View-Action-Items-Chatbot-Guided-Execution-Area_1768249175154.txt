Curated View – Action Items → Chatbot-Guided Execution

Area: Curated Views (Owner / GM / Executive Chef)
Type: Feature / Interaction
Component: Chatbot Assistant Integration

Problem

Curated Views surface insights and action items, but today they stop short of execution.

GMs and Owners often ask:

“Okay, what do I actually do now?”

“Where do I even start?”

Static dashboards create awareness, but do not close the loop between insight → action → outcome.

Goal

Make every action item in Curated Views actionable by launching a context-aware chatbot assistant that guides the user step-by-step to resolve the issue.

This turns Curated Views into decision + execution surfaces, not just reporting.

Core Concept

Every action item is a doorway into the assistant.

Clicking an action item:

Opens the chatbot assistant

Preloads full context

Guides the user through the recommended action

Action Item Behavior (Required)
Interaction

Each action item is clickable

On click:

Chatbot assistant opens (side panel or modal)

Assistant is pre-seeded with:

The detected issue

Relevant metrics

Timeframe

Role context (Owner / GM / Exec Chef)

Example Action Items → Assistant Flows
Example 1: GM – Overstaffed Lunch Shift

Action Item (UI)

“Lunch was overstaffed vs a typical Monday”

On Click → Assistant Opens With

Context:
• Role: GM
• Day: Monday
• Shift: Lunch

Assistant Flow

“Lunch labor ran higher than demand today.”

“Was staffing adjusted after 1pm?”

“Any call-outs or training shifts?”

Suggests actions:

Reduce overlap

Optional next step:

“Want me to flag next Monday’s lunch schedule?”

Example 2: Owner – Prime Cost Risk
