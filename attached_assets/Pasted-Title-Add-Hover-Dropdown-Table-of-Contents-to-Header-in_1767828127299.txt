Title
Add Hover Dropdown Table of Contents to Header in P&L Detailed View

Context
In /accounting/pnl, the Detailed View page contains multiple sections with distinct headers (e.g. Revenue, COGS, Labor, Operating Expenses, etc.). Currently, users must scroll to navigate between these sections, which becomes inefficient for long P&L reports.

To improve navigability and scanning, we want to add a dropdown table of contents in the page header where it currently says “Detailed View”.

Objective
Replace or enhance the “Detailed View” header label with a hover-activated dropdown table of contents that allows users to quickly jump to any section on the page.

Scope / Requirements

1. Header Interaction

The text “Detailed View” in the header should act as a hover trigger

On hover, display a dropdown menu containing a list of sections

Dropdown should close on mouse leave or outside click

2. Table of Contents Structure

Each dropdown item must correspond to a section header on the Detailed View page

Examples (exact list should be dynamically generated):

Overview

Revenue

Cost of Goods Sold

Labor

Operating Expenses

Other Income / Expense

Net Income

Section labels should match the visible header text exactly

3. Navigation Behavior

Clicking a section in the dropdown scrolls the user smoothly to that section

URL hash may update (optional but preferred) to support deep linking

Scrolling manually should not break dropdown behavior

4. Dynamic & Resilient

TOC should be generated dynamically from the page’s section headers

Adding/removing sections in the Detailed View should automatically update the dropdown

Avoid hardcoding section names

5. UI / UX

Dropdown should be visually lightweight and consistent with existing header styling

Current section (based on scroll position) may optionally be highlighted

Should work across screen sizes (desktop first, graceful degradation on smaller screens)

Acceptance Criteria

Hovering over “Detailed View” shows a dropdown TOC

Dropdown lists all sections present on the page

Clicking an item scrolls to the correct section

No layout shift or header flicker on hover

No regression to existing P&L Detailed View functionality

Notes

This feature is meant to act as a fast navigation aid, not a sidebar replacement

Should feel instant and discoverable without adding visual clutter

Align behavior with other hover-based controls in Accounting where possible
