Action Cart for P&L Insights (Chatbot-Driven)
Title

Add Action Cart to Chatbot for P&L Action Items (Click-to-Add + AI Suggestions)

Goal

Introduce an Action Cart that lets users:

Click action items directly from /accounting/pnl

Accumulate them in the chatbot (like a shopping cart)

Review, assign, or act on them later

Receive AI-suggested actions based on P&L data that may need attention or monitoring

This creates a bridge between insight → intent → action.

Core Concept

The chatbot maintains a persistent action queue (session-scoped) that contains:

User-selected action items

AI-suggested action items

Status metadata (new / assigned / dismissed)

The cart is not execution — it is an intent staging area.

User Flows
1. Click-to-Add from /accounting/pnl

On /accounting/pnl, actionable insights should expose an “Add to Actions” affordance.

Examples:

“Labor % increased 4.2% MoM”

“Food cost exceeded target”

“Delivery commissions trending up”

When clicked:

Item is added to the chatbot Action Cart

User receives lightweight confirmation:

“Added to Actions”

2. Chatbot Action Cart UI

The chatbot displays:

An Action Cart icon / indicator with count

A panel listing all current action items

Each item shows:

Title

Source (P&L, AI suggestion)

Reason / metric

Timestamp

3. AI-Suggested Action Items

The chatbot should proactively suggest action items when:

Metrics breach thresholds

Trends deteriorate MoM

Costs grow faster than revenue

Variance exceeds materiality thresholds

Examples:

“Review labor scheduling for October”

“Investigate rising DoorDash commissions”

“Monitor beverage cost volatility”

Suggested items must be:

Clearly labeled as Suggested

Optional to add

Dismissible

4. Review & Take Action

Users can later say:

“Show my action items”

“Assign these to my GM”

“Mark this as monitoring only”

“Remove this item”

(No execution logic in v1 — assignment is conceptual.)

Action Item Data Model
{
  "id": "action_123",
  "title": "Review labor cost increase",
  "source": "pnl_insight | ai_suggestion | user_click",
  "metric": "Labor % of Sales",
  "context": "Labor increased 4.2% MoM in Oct 2025",
  "status": "new | assigned | dismissed",
  "created_at": "timestamp"
}

AI Suggestion Rules (v1)

Suggestions should be generated when:

% of income exceeds prior month by configurable threshold

Absolute delta exceeds materiality threshold

Negative margin movement is detected

Suggestions must:

Reference exact metrics

Avoid prescriptive steps

Be phrased as review / monitor / investigate

Chatbot Integration Rules

Action Cart lives inside chatbot state

Adding items does NOT interrupt chat flow

Suggested items appear inline or as a soft prompt:

“I noticed a few areas worth reviewing — want to add them to Actions?”

Non-Goals (Explicit)

No task execution

No calendar integration

No notifications

No multi-user workflow logic

No persistence beyond session (v1)

UX Principles

Lightweight

Non-blocking

Dismissible

Explicit user consent for adding suggested items

Acceptance Criteria

 Users can add action items from /accounting/pnl

 Action Cart count updates in chatbot

 AI suggests relevant action items

 Suggested items are optional

 Users can view, remove, or assign items

 Action Cart is session-persistent

 No impact on existing reports or P&L rendering

Engineering Notes

This should be implemented as:

A shared Action Store

Accessible by:

/accounting/pnl

Chatbot

Decoupled from report generation

This sets up future:

Task assignment

Bonus tracking

SOP linking

AI follow-ups

Future Extensions (Not Included)

Persist actions across sessions

Link actions to SOPs

Assign to roles (Owner / GM / Chef)

Due dates and reminders

Bonus eligibility tracking
