Work Pipeline–Driven Operations

Prioritized task queue
Operators, managers, accountants, and support teams work from a single, role-aware task queue instead of navigating payroll runs, onboarding screens, or compliance reports. The system always surfaces the next best action—so teams focus on execution, not discovery.

Automated, role-based task routing
Tasks are automatically created, assigned, prioritized, and escalated based on payroll schedules, compliance deadlines, onboarding status, and data integrity—ensuring the right work reaches the right role at the right time.

Intelligent & Configurable by Design

Rules-based logic (no code required)
Define task triggers and workflows using business conditions like upcoming payroll runs, missing employee mappings, failed syncs, or tax deadlines—without engineering involvement.

Productized integrations
Connect POS, payroll, accounting, and tax systems quickly with API keys. The platform continuously monitors these integrations to detect gaps, failures, and mismatches.

Extensible operational schema
Add custom fields and calculations—such as pay schedules, location mappings, compliance attributes, or onboarding states—that behave like native system data and drive task creation.

Payroll Accuracy & Compliance Control

Preventative quality checks
The platform blocks payroll runs and compliance actions when critical data is missing, inconsistent, or non-compliant—surfacing clear tasks to resolve issues before employees or agencies are impacted.

Native automations
Automatically generate payroll reminders, mapping tasks, tax alerts, and anomaly investigations—eliminating manual checklists and last-minute fire drills.

Team Collaboration & Accountability

Multiplayer task resolution
Managers, accountants, onboarding specialists, and support can work simultaneously across the same company, location, or payroll run—with shared visibility into task status and ownership.

Complete audit trail
Every task action and data change is logged by user, timestamp, and context—providing full traceability across payroll, onboarding, and compliance workflows.

Speed, Focus & Operational Clarity

Global work queue navigation
Instantly search and filter tasks by priority, role, type, company, location, or payroll run—so users always know what’s urgent and why.

Built for payroll-critical performance
Fast-loading dashboards, stable integrations, and predictable task execution—designed to hold up during payroll windows, tax deadlines, and onboarding spikes.

Core Promise

Restaurant teams shouldn’t have to remember what to do next.
The Work Pipeline continuously watches the business and tells each user exactly what needs attention—before payroll breaks, deadlines are missed, or compliance slips.
